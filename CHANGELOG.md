## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-15

### Feature: Long Text Synthesis

This release introduces the capability to synthesize long-form text by splitting it into manageable chunks, processing them in the background, and concatenating the final audio.

The frontend now allows for long text inputs and has been revamped completely to be able to handle the status of the processing, to keep a history of previous long-text speech generations (and their configurations), etc.

### Added

#### Long Text Job Processing

- **Asynchronous Job Handling**: Implemented a background processing system to handle long text synthesis jobs without blocking the API.
- **New API Endpoints**: Introduced a new set of endpoints for creating long text jobs, querying their status, and performing bulk actions.
- **Audio Concatenation**: Integrated `pydub` to seamlessly concatenate generated audio chunks into a single, coherent audio file.

#### Frontend Integration

- **Job Management UI**: Added a new section in the frontend to submit text for long synthesis, monitor job progress, and download the final audio.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: The UI now displays the real-time status and progress of ongoing long text jobs.

#### Configuration & Dependencies

- **New Configuration**: Added environment variables to `.env.example` and `.env.example.docker` for configuring long text TTS behavior.
- **New Dependencies**: Added `pydub` for audio manipulation and `sse-starlette` to support job processing.

### Enhanced

#### Input Handling

- **Validation and Error Handling**: Improved validation for long text inputs to ensure job stability and provide clearer error feedback to the user.
